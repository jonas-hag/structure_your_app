# Exercise 2
# - rewrite the code from exercise 1 so that the module does not have a summary
#   checkboxInput
# - instead there is only one summary checkboxInput in the main app
# - rewrite the module from exercise 1 so that it has an additional
#   summary argument where you pass the summary value from the main app
# - now all datasets should change from raw view to summary view simultaneously
